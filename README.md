# GenderPayGap-over-the-years-DataAnalysis
Gender Pay Gap and Educational importance analysis using General Social Survey data for the years 1974 and 2018

A person’s income is not just impacted by personal criteria like education level and age but also social criteria like gender and occupational prestige score. Gender pay inequality remains a persistent issue globally, transcending geographical boundaries and socioeconomic strata. In this project, we delve into the intricate dynamics of the gender pay gap using empirical evidence drawn from the General Social Survey (GSS) spanning from 1974 to 2018. We would also like to understand how education level affects an individual’s salary and the occupation prestige score to examine if higher education improves a person’s income and how this trend varies across different occupations.

### Data preparation:

The original dataset contains 61697 entries collected over a period of 1974 to 2018. By constraining on the year, we reduce and split the dataset by selecting only the data from 1974 and 2018. The data was cleaned by removing the tuples with null values. Entries only with Full-time employment status were selected to give a common ground on hours of work for better analysis. After initial data cleaning, we got 522 entries for the 1974 dataset (348 males and 173 females) and 977 entries for the 2018 dataset (507 males and 469 females)
